    /* "@NSManged" . The @NSManaged attribute is similar to the @dynamic attribute in Objective-C. The @NSManaged attribute tells the compiler that the storage and implementation of these properties will be provided at runtime. While this may sound great, Apple's documentation clearly states that @NSManaged should only be used in the context of Core Data.
    
    If this sounds a bit confusing, then remember that @NSManaged is required for Core Data to do its work and the @NSManaged attribute should only be used for NSManagedObject subclasses. */
